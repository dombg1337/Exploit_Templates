## Why bother?

This set of scripts can be used to abuse a XSS-vulnerability that allows src'ing a malicious .js file to use a session of a victim for authenticated target enumeration, even when access to cookies is not granted (http-only flag set).

## sqlite3 db? 

The DB is used to store all scraped information, including requested file contents of endpoints, credentials and cookies (that do not have a http-only flag set).

## Note on Javascript, Authentication via cookies and http-only flag (basis of entire attack)

When a user's browser requests content from a web page (whether it is triggered by a refresh or by JavaScript), the browser will automatically include the session cookie in the request. 
This is true even if JavaScript doesn't have direct access to the cookie value (http-only flag set).
